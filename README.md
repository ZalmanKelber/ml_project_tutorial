# Machine Learning Tutorial

This is a straightforward implementation of this simple Machine Learning project walkthrough that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdfbcdP75KI&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uu7clOTtwsp94PcHbzqpAdg&index=2).  In a couple of places, from feature engineering to model selection, I diverged from the tutorial a bit. 

Because the web frontend generally relies on copy and pasted code, I didn't include most of it here, so there's no way to actually run my clone of the application, but the original code is available in the tutorial.
